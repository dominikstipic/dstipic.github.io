About information overloard.
One good way how to think about human brain is a big graph of an ideas or
concepts. Each concept references another concept. We call this
associations or activation functions.
An environment around us is the stage where we get sensory stimulans. For example, bird
passes in front of you, there is a black car which quickly passes in front
of you. 


Information warefare is a set of methodologies and methods how to
connect the stimulans with the mental model or the story which is triggered
when the stimulans is enforced. Information overload happens when the
concentration and organization of the stimulans in your environment is
placed in such way to proactively and tacticaly create a mental loop which
triggers emotions. In the case of the information warefare we are talking
about negative emotions. Negative emotions drains an energy, creates
behavioral fixation which is tough to remove. Unfortunately, modern
lifestyle, globalization and forces individual to adopt this customs.

Of course, this methodologies could be used in a positive ways which
enforces positive emotions, well behaved gruops where there is no negative
emotions such as jelaously
