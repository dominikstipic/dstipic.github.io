About innovation

Usually, in public discourse, we measure technological progress by the number of startups or products that come to light. In my opinion, this is an overly simplistic view of valuing technological progress. In a market economy, the price of a product is usually determined as a result of the bargaining process that determines the price of the product. In reality, the value of a product or innovation is determined by the productivity and creative effect it has on people's lives, without destroying a person's identity or integrity.
